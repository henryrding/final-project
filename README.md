# Henry's Hovel

A full stack e-commerce app for Magic: The Gathering Players to buy and sell cards online.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to build this project to demonstrate my programming skills while combining a personal interest of mine. As a web developer and an avid Magic: The Gathering player, I wanted to create an application that combines my technical expertise with my passion for the game which lets users browse and buy cards and admin users list cards for sale.
